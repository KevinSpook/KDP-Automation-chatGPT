# KDP-Automation-chatGPT
This was a simple python script I developed years ago for kdp automation.

You only need an IDE to execute this script prefereably python, and you will need to download pynput.

## PYnput ##

open cmd and execute this line of code:

python3 -m pip install pynput


https://pypi.org/project/pynput/


Now simply open chatgpt execute the code and click the chat bar.
Wait till a beep is played to let you know it's done.


I've previously set this script up on multiple virtual machines to cut down on time.
after grabbing the book just open a program where you can filter words and replace them easily i used sublime text.

After removing the useless parts you now have a complete book. Humamise it if you want or directly upload it.
